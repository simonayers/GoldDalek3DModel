# GoldDalek3DModel
Repository for development of a Gold 'Day of the Daleks' Dalek modelled in Cinema 4D

The model was created in a commercially licenced copy of Cinema 4D R21 and only requires the Prime edition of Cinema 4D to open it.
Once the model is completed additional more portable file formats will be included.

It was created as part of a livestream on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTl9KbXktb6-qOB7mcN9F1g) (username Simon Ayers) and is based on plans available from the [Project Dalek forum](http://www.projectdalek.com).

The model is free for anyone to use or to modify.  All I ask is that if redistributed, or if shared as part of a piece of artistic work that myself and Project Dalek get a shout out.

Also the model is provided as is, with no support or guarantee of compatibility provided.
